# Accelize Getting Started

Welcome to the Accelize getting Started repository.

This repository contains examples designs and application example to get you started with the Accelize Distribution Platform.

1. **Hardware** - DRM Integration in your ip or design
2. **Software** - Execute the DRM Library anywhere
3. **Cloud_Instructions** - Step-by-step setup instructions for FPGA Could (AWS, Azure, Nimbix, ...)
4. **Misc** - Some interessting guides on various topics



### 1. Hardware
A collection of example designs covering the DRM IPs integration in various development environments.

### 2. Software
A collection of example applications demonstrating how to use the DRM Library in various execution environments such as CSPs (AWS, Nimbix, Alibaba, Huawei, ...) or on-premise (Alveo U2XX, ...)

### 3. Cloud Instructions
For each Cloud Service Provider (CSP) offering FPGA-based instances the detailled instructions to create and configure an account, synthesize and run an example design.

### 4. Misc.
A collection of guides that doesn't deserve a sepecific section but that can be interessting anyway.
